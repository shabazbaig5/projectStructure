Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

More information
See our website for general information and support on the management of research data at Radboud University.
On the RIS website you can find guidelines concerning data archiving and writing your DMP in the DMP tool.

Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network.

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support.

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

See our website for general information and support on the management of research data at Radboud University.
On the RIS website you can find guidelines concerning data archiving and writing your DMP in the DMP tool.

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project.

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Sample text 3
“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

More information
See our website for general information and support on the management of research data at Radboud University.
On the RIS website you can find guidelines concerning data archiving and writing your DMP in the DMP tool.

“In my project, I cannot make (part of the) data publicly available after research due to legal reasons (ownership of secondary data) or ethical reasons (privacy of respondents; confidential data).” (if necessary followed by a more extensive explanation)

2. Storage during research
It is a good idea to add information about the protocols Radboud University and your institute have for storing data securely while research is ongoing, for instance regarding storing personal or sensitive data, for backing up, and for data processing in unsafe environments. Below you will find several sample texts.

Sample text 1
“Radboud University recommends that while research is ongoing, data is stored on the campus network. Safe and secure storage is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network. In addition, it is proposed that Surfdrive (for non-personal data) or the campus network (for (sensitive) personal data) can be used to exchange between researchers during the project. If it is not possible to store the data directly on the campus network, data is stored encrypted on a local device (laptop) and transferred to the campus network as soon as possible.”

Sample text 2
“In line with the policy of Radboud University, while research is ongoing, data will be stored on the campus network. For this purpose, [department name] has its own server space which is supported by the IT department. This server space allows for managed access to and the sharing of data between and among partners and guests during the project. Safe and secure storage of data is guaranteed by the IT security and safety protocols of the campus network.”

3. Storage, curation, preservation and access after research
Radboud University has a research data management policy that is supplemented by each research institute. Researchers are requested to comply with their institutional policies by archiving their data for the long term, and whenever possible, making it available for reuse.

Sample text
“Radboud University and its institutes have set strict conditions for the management of research data. In accordance with the university’s research data management (RDM) policy all research data will be archived for reasons of scientific integrity for 10 years after completion of the project. All data suitable for reuse will be made available to the scientific community, together with their accompanying metadata and documentation necessary to understand the data. To this end the services of the Research Information System (RIS) of Radboud University will be used. Via RIS, data sets are made available at DANS, a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both."

If applicable, adjust the text below to your own research and add to the sample text: “All data not suitable for reuse, due to legal or ethical reasons, will be stored for 10 years, but not made publicly available to others after research. Legally, it might not be possible to share data because of ownership or intellectual property rights. Ethical reasons concern for example the privacy of participants or confidentiality. Possible access to these forms of data and its storage and processing will be in line with the privacy requirements of the EU GDPR directive.”

4. Facilities necessary during and after research
Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”

Data management paragraph
Are you writing a grant proposal but you are unsure about what to answer to questions on the data management of your project?

When applying for funding, it becomes more and more common practice to write a data management paragraph. On this document, you will find several sample texts, subdivided by topics regularly asked in data management paragraphs.

For support in drafting your data management paragraph or feedback, please get in touch with RDM Support or the data steward of your institute.

1. Reuse of data
Most funders are in favour of open access and the reuse of research data. It is useful to keep this in mind when writing your data management paragraph.

Sample text 1
“It is the policy of Radboud University in general and our research institute [name research institute] in particular to share with the scientific community any data obtained in research projects, as long as ethical and legal regulations permit it. The university strives to publish the results, as well as supporting data in its raw, processed and analysed states, in a long-term data archive to which access may be open, or restricted, or both.”

Sample text 2 (brief)
“The general Radboud University RDM policy and the detailed RDM policy of our institute encourages reuse of data. The policies are published at https://www.ru.nl/rdm/vm/rdm-policy/.”

However, there may be good reasons not to make all your data available for reuse, or at least not right away. Perhaps some of your data will not be of interest to others, or perhaps you do not own them. It might also be the case that your data is privacy- or competition-sensitive. In most research projects data can be made available for reuse, but if this is not the case, please explain clearly why.

Some funders ask if certain extra facilities are necessary, for example ICT, archive, refrigerators or legal expertise. If this is not the case and all the facilities you need are already provided for at your institute, you can refer to the sample text under “storage during research”.

Sample text
“As outlined above, all facilities necessary to store and share research data are available at Radboud University. No further facilities are necessary.”

5. Data management plan
State that you are going to write a data management plan before (most funders) or in the first months (EU funding) after start of your project. You can write and collaborate on your DMP using the Radboud University’s DMP tool, which includes most funder formats.

Sample text
“Before the start of the project, all issues of data management will be addressed in a fully-fledged data management plan. For this, Radboud University has a DMP tool, that includes feedback from RDM Support. Training and support in writing a data management plan are offered to the researchers involved by the section RDM Support (University Library, Radboud University) and the data steward of the institute.”

6. Support
Radboud University has a support service for issues concerning the management of research data (www.ru.nl/rdm), as well as dedicated data stewards in each research institute. All questions that arise during the research project can be addressed to RDM Support of Radboud University or the data steward.

Sample text
“RDM Support (https://www.ru.nl/rdm) together with the data stewards help researchers to store, share and reuse research data by offering training in writing a data management plan as well as providing support with any legal and ethical questions that may arise.”
